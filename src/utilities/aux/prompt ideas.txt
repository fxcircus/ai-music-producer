Response:
=========
Fleet Foxes often use a folk-inspired sound with rich harmonies and acoustic instrumentation. One key that can work well for writing a song in their style is:

Scale name: Mixolydian Mode
Scale notes:

Root (tonic)
Major second
Major third
Perfect fourth
Perfect fifth
Major sixth
Minor seventh
In the key of C, the Mixolydian mode would have the following notes:

C (Root)
D
E
F
G
A
Bb
This scale has a slightly different flavor compared to the standard major scale because of the lowered seventh note (Bb instead of B). It gives a folk or country-like feel and can be heard in many Fleet Foxes songs. Combine this scale with intricate vocal harmonies and acoustic instrumentation, and you're on your way to capturing their style.
